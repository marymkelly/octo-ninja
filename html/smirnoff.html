	<div><h2> Smirnoff </h2></div>
	<div>This alcohol is also primarily mixed with vodka. It has an ABV ranging from 35 to 50%.<br><br>

	This is a brand of vodka that is owned and produced by the British company, Diageo. This bran had begun with a vodka distillery that was founded in Moscow, Russia by Pyotr Arsenevich Smirnov. Now, this is distributed in 130 countries and is produced in several countries which include India, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. All Smirnoff products are as follows; vodka, flavored vodka, and malts.<br><br>

	Pyotr Smirnov had founded his distillery in 1864 under the name PA Smirnoff, which was pioneering charcoal filtration during the 1870s and became first to use newspaper ads and charitable donations to the clergy to shut down anti-vodka sermons. When Pyotr died in 1898, his son Vladimir Smirnov inherited his company. </div>
