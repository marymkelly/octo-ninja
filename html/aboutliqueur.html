	<div><h2> About Liqueur </h2></div>
	<div> A liqueur is a sweet distilled spirit with sugar contents starting at 2.5 percent, with the sweetest (ie. cremes) going far beyond that. <br><br>

	These spirits often begin with a base liquor, which could be anything from a neutral grain alcohol to a brandy, whiskey, or rum. Sugar is added too the base along with a mix of herbs, fruits or spices depending on the desired result and flavor. <br><br>

	There are distinct classes of liqueurs, such as absinthe, amaretto, curacao, Irish cream, and triple sec, for which a variety of brands are available.</div>

<h3>Step 1. Infuse ingredients or flavorings</h3><br><br>

<u>Prepare all ingredients to be infused</u><br>

At this point you need to cut, smash, quarter, pulpify, or wash your various ingredients. Be sure that everything is clean, fresh and ready to go into the alcohol. You are preparing everything except your sweetener because you typically don't add it at this stage in the process.<br><br>

<u>Place into sealed container with alcohol</u>
<br>
You will need a dark undisturbed area to keep your steeping liqueur. Place all of your ingredients into your base alcohol and seal the container. Now put it in your dark place.<br><br>

<u>Let steep for X time</u><br>

As with most of the steps, this depends on the recipe. You will typically see two to four weeks as the steeping time, but you can vary this at will to make the taste stronger or lighter. You may need to taste test the steeping liquid and move onto straining and filtering when the taste seems right. This part of the process can definitely be an art.<br><br>

<h3>Step 2. Strain and Filter your flavored alcohol</h3>

<u>Prepare containers and filters</u><br>

Now you have an infused vodka or base alcohol. You need to get your containers set up that you will be transferring your concoction into.<br><br>

<u>Three stage filtration</u><br>

Starting with the most loose or rough filter. Pour the infused alcohol slowly through the filter into one of your containers. If you have large chunks of fruit or other matter, you may need to wrap them in your straining material and squeeze. Then do the same but with the medium filter and finally the finest filter.<br><br>

At any time during straining and filtering, if the material clogs up quickly you will probably need to perform that filter stage twice or more.<br><br>

If you decide you like the flavor without sweetening it. Then by all means move on to Aging and skip the sweetening step. (of course then it is not really a Liqueur, but still could be tasty)<br><br>

<h3>Step 3. Add sweetener (honey, sugar, syrup, etc)</h3><br><br>

<u><strong>This is really what makes it a Liqueur and not just infused vodka or alcohol</strong></u><br><br>

A huge part of the flavor profile is <strong>SWEET</strong>. That means whatever you decide to sweeten the liqueur with will be maybe the biggest component of flavor. You can change that depending on how much sweet you add. Whatever you choose try to compliment the other flavors involved. <br><br>

<u>Add in your sweet stuff</u><br>

Adding a sweetening agent could be as simple as pouring in a cup of honey. Or you may need to boil sugar in water to make a simple syrup. Generally follow the recipe. However I feel that plain refined sugar lacks a lot of flavor. Honey seems to work better in many cases. Be aware that there are several varieties of honey. <br><br>

<h3>Step 4. Age your Liqueur</h3><br><br>

<u>Place into another sealed container</u><br>

Now that you have added sweet into your infused alcohol, you can drink your delicious beverage or age it to let flavors mingle. This is where many home liqueuer makers will place the sweetened liqueur into a bottle and cork it or seal it air tight. Again find a dark undisturbed place to keep your Liqueur. Keep it out of sight as well, as you don't want to be tempted to open it before it is ready. I say that , but when you first start doing this, it is a good idea to taste your Liqueurs often to see how the flavor changes as they age. <br><br>

<u>Age for X time based on recipe</u><br>

For almost every recipe you will want at least a few weeks of aging. Some recipes will tell you to just drink it now, but most get better with time. Be wary that at some point, months or years away the flavor may start to turn. However it should never become harmful if the alcohol content is high enough, which it always is in a true Liqueur.</div>
