	<div><h2> About Liquor </h2></div>
	<div>Liquor is made by distilling wine or beer down to a more concentrated form. The different types of spirits that are produced reflect the different types of beer and wine (called the wash) that are put into the still as well as the method used to age the liquor (if at all), and for how long. <br><br>

	Beer and wine have a ceiling on how strong they can be produced. Once the alcohol level gets above 15% or so, the solution becomes toxic to the yeast. Some strains of yeast have been developed to push the envelope higher into the 20% range, but it is not really feasible to go much higher. In order to strengthen the beverage into a liquor, the beer or wine is heated to the boiling point for ethanol 173 degrees Fahrenheit (78.4 degrees Celcius) at sea level. <br><br>

	The ethyl alcohol vapor evaporates below the temperature of water, and so the alcohol is "stripped" from the solution. </div>

	<div style="color:white"> <h3>How is Liquor Made?</h3><br>
		Liquors are distilled alcoholic beverages that have gone through a fementation and distillation process. Different liquors are made from different ingredients. Some examples are below. <br><br>

		<h3>Rum</h3><br>
		Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels.<br><br>

		<h3>Whiskey</h3><br>
		Whisky is a certain type of distilled alcoholic drink that is made from fermented grain mash. There are many grains which can also be malted that are used for different varieties of whisky. These can include barley, corn, rye, and wheat. It is typically aged in wood casks, which are normally made of a charred white oak.<br><br>

		<h3>Vodka</h3><br>
		Vodka is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of fermented grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.
